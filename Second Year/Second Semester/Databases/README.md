# Children's Palace of Cluj-Napoca — Database Project

## Overview
This project represents the design and implementation of a relational database for the Children's Palace of Cluj-Napoca, an educational institution that provides various courses and activities for children aged 3 to 18.  
The goal was to create a database that supports efficient management of participants, activities, teachers, scheduling, and payments.

## Structure
The database includes seven main entities: Participants, Payments, Age Groups, Rates, Activities, Appointments, and Employees.  
All tables are connected through primary and foreign keys to ensure referential integrity. The database schema was normalized and implemented using Oracle SQL and Oracle APEX.

## Implementation
The implementation involved:
- Creating and normalizing database tables  
- Defining constraints and relationships between entities  
- Populating tables with test data  
- Creating SQL views for simplified data visualization  
- Performing updates and modifications to maintain data consistency

## Purpose
The project demonstrates the complete process of designing, building, and maintaining a normalized relational database, suitable for managing educational activities, resources, and transactions in a real institutional environment.

## Technologies Used
- Oracle SQL / Oracle APEX  
- Entity-Relationship Modeling (ERD)  
- Data Normalization (up to 3NF)  
- SQL Views and Constraints
